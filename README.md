# INFOTC-1600

~~National Champions~~

Kidding. Maybe in a few years, but I don't think this new team is there quite yet. Here is what I think will happen over the next few games:

| Opponent | Result |
| -------- | -------- |
| Mississippi Valley State | W, 96-64 |
| Coastal Carolina | W, 84-72 |
| Houston Christian | W, 83-58 |
| Wichita State | W, 74-70 |
| Southeast Missouri State | W, 93-77 |
| kansas | L, 88-79 |

That's right, as much as I want us to beat kansas, I think we still need a little more time to gel as a team. I hope I'm wrong, but I would not bet against it.
